Currently just for the PID controller team (Paul Nadan and William Derksen)

We're pretty legit

TODO:
 - Calculate absolute position from sensor values (Gyro and Accelerometer)
    - Transform relative accelerations to absolutes
    - Calculate double integral and save value.
 - Correct absolute position based on GPS.
 - Convert PID output to relative coordinates based on current pitch roll and yaw.
 - Calculate Individual motor values from PID output
